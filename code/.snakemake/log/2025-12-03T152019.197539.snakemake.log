Error in rule list_download:

        bash 1-ID_list_download.sh ../data/raw/IDs/IDs.xml
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
